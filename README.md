## This resource contains the following data regarding the analyses described in the paper:

### Gene signature validations and comparisons based on the HTG gene panel

[*Subdirectory:  Fig7_SFig9*](https://github.com/tkarn/Penelope-HTG/blob/main/Fig7_SFig9/):  Analyses and figures comparing Recurrence-Score, GGI, SET-Index in TCGA samples based on all genes and the subset of genes available among the 2549 genes from the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel measured on the HTG-Molecular EdgeSeq platform.

************************************************************

### AIMS subtyping based on the HTG gene panel:

[*Subdirectory: AIMS*](https://github.com/tkarn/Penelope-HTG/blob/main/AIMS/):  Calculation of the AIMS subtypes for TCGA samples based on either all genes from the AIMS rules or only on the subset of genes available among the 2549 genes from the HTG EdgeSeq Oncology Biomarker Panel measured on the HTG-Molecular EdgeSeq platform.

************************************************************

### Relationship of gene clusters and survival:
[*Subdirectory: Fig4*](https://github.com/tkarn/Penelope-HTG/blob/main/Fig4/):  
Analysis comparing the prognostic value of individual genes and their association with gene clusters from unsupervised clustering of Penelope-B samples.

************************************************************

### Analysis of prognostic gene sets in pre-Tx biopsies and post-Tx residual tumors:
[*Subdirectory: SFig5*](https://github.com/tkarn/Penelope-HTG/blob/main/SFig5/):  
Normalized Enrichment Scores (NES) of pathways for iDFS prognosis from Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) are compared for pre-Tx biopsies and post-Tx residual tumors in a scatter plot.
