### Suppl. Figure S5: Comparison of the genes included in the main Penelope-B gene clusters with the TCGA cohort shown in Fig.S5C.

1. [*n335genes_TCGA_SFig5.cdt*](https://github.com/tkarn/Penelope-HTG/blob/main/SFig5/n335genes_TCGA_SFig5.cdt): A clustered data table (cdt) format file which can be opened in JavaTreeView (https://jtreeview.sourceforge.net/). The file contains the median centered RNA-Seq data of the 355 differentially expressed genes for 1215 BRCA samples from TCGA. Level 3 RNA-Seq data were downloaded from UCSC cancer browser (https://genome-cancer.ucsc.edu/; dataset ID TCGA_BRCA_exp_HiSeqV2, version "2015-01-28"). This dataset contains 1095 primary tumors, 7 metastasis, 113 normal tissue.
